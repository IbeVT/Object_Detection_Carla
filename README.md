# Object Detection Carla
This repository aims to provide an object detection system in carla simulation environment. YOLOv3 algorithm is chosen as a detector system to detect and classify pedestriants, vehicles and objects on the road. This algorithm is based on [YOLOv3: An Incremental Improvement](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/papers/YOLOv3.pdf) which originaly implemented in [YOLOv3](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet)
# Installation
To start with the implementation
1) Download [CARLA simulator](https://carla.org/2020/12/22/release-0.9.11/) (version 0.9.11).

2) Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/shayantaherian/Object_Detection_Carla.git
```
3) Copy `Object_Detection.py` in `CARLA_0.9.11/PythonAPI/examples` folder.#

5) Run `CarlaUÂ£4.exe` to connect with the server.

6) Finally run `Object_Detection.py`.
